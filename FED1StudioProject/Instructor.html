                Technical Instructor Lead: Hondo Ohnaka<br />A tough, pragmatic Weequay, Hondo Ohnaka led a notorious Outer Rim pirate gang from his headquarters on Florrum. A former colleague of Jango Fett and a former lover of Aurra Sing, Ohnaka won fame during the Clone Wars when he kidnapped Count Dooku, Obi-Wan Kenobi, and Anakin Skywalker and tried to ransom all three for a big payout. Since that incident, Ohnaka continues to serve himself, not being above robbing, blinding, or betraying his friends and foes.

                Instructor: Hera Syndulla<br />The captain and heart of the Ghost crew, Hera Syndulla was a gifted pilot and leader. While Hera was a strong commander -- and especially adept at dogfighting with TIE fighters -- she was also warm and nurturing. The Twi’lek could bring out the best in her team, which consisted of very different personalities, making them believe in themselves, each other, and their struggle against the Empire.

                Instructor: Quarrie<br />A short, prideful Mon Calamari, Quarrie was a master engineer who created the Blade Wing — commonly known as the B-wing. He enjoyed his work, and was eager to experiment in speed, agility, and weaponry, though he was no pilot himself. During the early days of the rebellion, Quarrie gifted his B-wing to Hera and Phoenix Squadron, helping turn the tide in one key battle and giving the fleet some much-needed firepower.
